# Overview

As a software engineer, I am working to be proficient in software design. I am creating programs to practice different elements of programming to become more comfortable and efficient. I am always trying to find new and better ways to program. In this Python program, it simply prints "Hellos World" to the console. I made this program to begin my software design portfolio. It demonstrates the use of Visual Studio Code, Github, and Python.
